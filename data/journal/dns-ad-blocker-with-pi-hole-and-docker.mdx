## What‚Äôs Pi-hole?

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is an all-in-one network solution for blocking ads. By sitting as a middle-man between your router and devices it can accept all traffic as a gateway that decides what domains are allowed.

## The 4 pillars of Pi-hole

### üì° Network Wide Protection

Instead of installing browser extensions or blockers for each individual device, you can let your Pi-hole have complete governance over your network. Therefore all of the devices connected to this network will be protected without the need of installing any additional software!

### üö´ Block in-app ads

Sometimes tech companies get smart and put ads in unconventional places, like mobile apps and Smart TVs. In some cases, like a TV, installing a local ad-blocker is not even an opportunity. Yet again, Pi-hole comes to the rescue regardless of hardware or OS.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Improve network latency

Since Pi-hole can block the HTTP query at a DNS level, filthy javascript trackers won‚Äôt even reach your browser. This results in less packets and bandwidth usage. It might not be immediately noticeable, but significant in the long run.

### ü§ì Monitors stats

For all the ‚Äúnerds‚Äù out there, Pi-hole comes with a full-fledged and battle-tested dashboard. It acts as a hub to monitor network traffic, permitted/blocked domains, clients, etc.

## Getting Started

Pi-hole officially supports a variety of [linux distributions](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequisites/), but by leveraging [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) we are going to automate installation & configuration for any platform.

Note: For a one step automated install and manual configuration you can check out the [official guide](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#one-step-automated-install).

## Docker

Let‚Äôs start by creating a `docker-compose.yml` file that will take care of the configuration. Luckily the vibrant community from Pi-hole already has us covered with a [docker image](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker) ready for distribution.

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
environment:
      TZ: "America/Los_Angeles"
      WEBTHEME: "default-dark"
      PIHOLE_DNS_: "1.1.1.1;1.0.0.1"
      FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4: "192.168.0.143"
      WEBPASSWORD: "${WEBPASSWORD}"
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - "./etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/"
      - "./etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/"
    # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)
    # https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Most of the things are boilerplate, setting a `container_name` that acts as display name, getting the docker `image`, and opening the right `ports` for communication between our container and the host. `volumes` are used for persisting data across container upgrades.

The `environment` is one the most important keys that defines our settings. Let‚Äôs go over each one:

- `TZ`: set a [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) to make sure logs are timestamped with your local time.
- `WEBTHEME`: set a user interface theme to use, options: `"default-dark" | "default-darker" | "default-light"`
- `PIHOLE_DNS_`: set a DNS server that‚Äôs going to resolve all network queries. The default is Google, but here I‚Äôm manually changing it to Cloudfare.
- `FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4`: set your host‚Äôs LAN IP
- `WEBPASSWORD`: set a password that allows you to access the dashboard. You can set it directly inline, or through an external `.env` file. For doing the latter, create a file named `.env` in the same directory and add the following line: `WEBPASSWORD=helloworld`.

The most important properties that are recommended to set are the last two. Everything else is optional, you can read more about it on their [github](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker).

### Installation

Beforehand, you will need to have installed on your machine `docker` and `docker-compose`. Running is as simple as navigating to the directory of your `docker-compose.yml` and typing `docker compose up -d`.

## Post Install

<FancyImage src="/images/journal/dns-ad-blocker-with-pi-hole-and-docker/login.png" height="1261px" width="1468px" />

In order to access the dashboard navigate to `<FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4>/admin`. Now that we‚Äôve got our instance of Pi-hole running, the last step is to forward all traffic to it. Unfortunately, this topic is out of scope for this article. The [official documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/post-install/) extensively covers how to configure your router to have DHCP clients use Pi-hole as their DNS server.

## Voil√†!

Assuming that you have done your network setup, now you should have a dedicated ad-blocker for your whole household. In the past month since I‚Äôve set this, Pi-hole has blocked 152 queries. This result means that a bit over 1% of my network traffic is made up of advertisement & trackers and has been all blocked automatically by my Pi-hole instance.
