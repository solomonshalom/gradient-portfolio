If you are interested in how we created the flower and breathing animation, you can check out the [first part](/journal/recreate-apples-breathing-animation-in-swiftui-part-1) of this tutorial.

To achieve this stunning effect, we are going to split the problem into two parts. We will need to do the following two things:

1. Create a mask around the flower view
2. Create a blur-fade effect

If you are a bit confused about what we are doing and why, just hold on for a second. It will start to make a lot of sense near the end.

## Create a Mask Around the Flower View

You would think that this is relatively easy — just add a `.background()` modifier to the flower view and call it a day, but…

<FancyImage

/>

As you can see, this doesn’t quite solve the problem. Because the flower view is composed of multiple circles, the simplest way to create a background for the flower view would be with a whole other flower view that is in sync with the animation.

Let’s implement this by embedding our original `FlowerView` in a `ZStack` and add the secondary `FlowerView` that acts as a background. Make these changes to `ContentView`.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  // ...
  var body: some View {
    List {
      // Flower
      Section {
        ZStack {
          // This FlowerView creates a mask around the Main FlowerView
          FlowerView(
            isMinimized: $isMinimized,
            numberOfPetals: $numberOfPetals,
            animationDuration: $animationDuration,
            color: Color(UIColor.black)
          )

          // Main FlowerView
          FlowerView(
            isMinimized: $isMinimized,
            numberOfPetals: $numberOfPetals,
            animationDuration: $animationDuration
          )
        }

        // align the flower nicely
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .padding(.vertical, 32)
      }

      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Blur-Fade Effect

If we look closely, the blur-fade animation has three key points:

- Blur effect
- Opacity change from 1 to 0
- Lagging behind compared to the original shrinking animation

<FancyImage

/>

It should come as no surprise to you that we are going to achieve this by adding another `FlowerView` to the `ZStack`.

This time we are going to hide and show our third `FlowerView` based on the `isMinimized` property and create a custom transition modifier that should create the blur-fade effect when shrinking.

Create a new Swift file or add this after `ContentView`.

```swift
extension AnyTransition {
  static var blurFade: AnyTransition {
    get {
      AnyTransition.modifier(
        active: BlurFadeModifier(isActive: true),
        identity: BlurFadeModifier(isActive: false)
      )
    }
  }
}

struct BlurFadeModifier: ViewModifier {
  let isActive: Bool

  func body(content: Content) -> some View {
    content
      .scaleEffect(isActive ? 1.5 : 1) // lagging behind effect
      .blur(radius: isActive ? 8 : 0)
      .opacity(isActive ? 0 : 0.7)
  }
}
```

Almost done! Now let’s add the final `FlowerView`. We will also create a `fadeDuration` property that is based on the `breathingAnimation` duration.

Note that we are using an asymmetric transition because we don’t want the blur-fade effect both ways.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  // ...
  /// Duration of the BlurFade transition based on the **breathingAnimation**
  private var fadeDuration: Double {
    return breathDuration * 0.6
  }

  var body: some View {
    List {
      Section {
        // Flower
        ZStack {
          if !isMinimized { // second lil' hack
            FlowerView(
              isMinimized: $isMinimized,
              numberOfPetals: $numberOfPetals,
              animationDuration: $animationDuration
            ).transition(
              AnyTransition.asymmetric(
                insertion: AnyTransition.opacity.animation(Animation.default.delay(animationDuration)),
                removal: AnyTransition.blurFade.animation(Animation.easeIn(duration: fadeDuration))
              )
              /**
                General Observation - use real devices for best results
                Asymmetric Transitions are sometimes buggy, this includes:
                  - animationDuration is not always updated prior to a change
                  - the removal transition is used for an insertion
              */
            )
          }

          // ...
        }

        // align the flower nicely
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .padding(.vertical, 32)
      }

      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

As you can see, by using simple built-in shapes and animations, we managed to compose a pretty complex animation.

If you are feeling brave enough, now I encourage you to try and make your own animations! PS: Make sure you tweet about it and let me know.

Here’s the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Pondorasti/WatchOSBreathingAnimation) with the complete project.
